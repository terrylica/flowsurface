# Bar Selection Stats Panel

---

## Trader's Guide

This section is written entirely in plain English. No formulas. The goal is to teach
you what each part of the panel is telling you, so you can act on it.

---

### What the Panel Is Measuring

Every ODB bar has a trade intensity — how many trades per second arrived at the exchange
while that bar was forming. A bar that formed in 3 seconds with 600 trades has intensity
200 t/s. A bar that took 45 seconds with 90 trades has intensity 2 t/s.

The panel asks: **were the bars that went up more urgently traded than the bars that went
down?**

A bar moving up with 200 t/s arriving is a contested, urgent, potentially climactic event.
The same move with 2 t/s is a slow drift through thin air. Both close higher — the
microstructure story is opposite.

Select a range of bars with Shift+Click to anchor, then Shift+Click again to set the
other end. The panel appears at the top of the chart. Drag it anywhere on screen if it
covers your candles. Drag either highlighted brim to resize the selection in real time.

---

### The Metrics at a Glance

**Header row** — always visible at the top:

```
15 bars    ↑ 9  (60%)    ↓ 6  (40%)
```

This is the raw count. 15 bars total, 9 closed up (60%), 6 closed down (40%). This alone
tells you direction bias, but nothing about intensity.

---

**↑t / ↓t** — intensity rank, within this selection

```
↑t 0.68  ↑ 124 t/s      ↓t 0.41  ↓ 82 t/s
```

The first number (0.68, 0.41) is a 0-to-1 score: where did this direction's bars land
in the intensity ranking within your selection? 0.68 for up-bars means they were, on
average, in the top 32% of urgency within this window. 0.41 for down-bars means they
were in the middle.

The second number (124 t/s, 82 t/s) is the raw trades-per-second average for each direction.

Key insight: you can compare two completely different time-of-day selections by the 0-to-1
score. The raw t/s varies by session (NY open is busier than 3 AM), but "top 32%" means
the same thing whenever you selected it.

---

**ASCII bar + flow (IWDS)**

```
[██████░░░░]  flow: +0.22  ← lean
```

The block bar is a quick visual: center (5 blocks) = neutral. More blocks = buyers more
urgent. Fewer blocks = sellers more urgent. The `flow` number is exact: how much of the
total trading urgency flowed through up-bars vs down-bars.

+1.0 would mean every single trade happened during up-bars. -1.0 means all trades during
down-bars. In practice, anything beyond ±0.3 is meaningful directional loading.

The suffix tells you the interpretation at a glance (see "Inline Suffixes" below).

---

**Regime label** — the synthesized verdict

```
BULL CONVICTION
```

or

```
BEAR ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split
```

This is the panel's one-line verdict. See "The Regime Label" below for what each label means.

---

**Urgency caption**

```
buyers 1.4× more urgent  ← structural edge
```

Raw speed comparison: buyers were arriving 1.4× faster (in trades per second) than
sellers, on average. The suffix grades how significant that edge is.

---

**P(↑>↓) and log₂**

```
P(↑>↓): 73%   log₂: +0.74  ← moderate
```

P(↑>↓) = 73% means: if you randomly pick one up-bar and one down-bar and compare their
intensity, the up-bar wins 73% of those matchups. 50% means no edge.

log₂ = +0.74 means buyers averaged about 1.67× more raw t/s than sellers (2^0.74 ≈ 1.67).
Positive = buyers faster. Negative = sellers faster.

---

**conv and absorp**

```
conv: 1.85×   absorp: 0.46  ← minority active
```

Conviction asks: is the majority direction (more bars) also the more urgently traded
direction? 1.85× means yes — the side with more bars was 85% more intense. Below 1.0
is a warning: the majority direction is less intense than the minority.

Absorption asks: how hard was the losing side fighting? 0.46 = middle of the road —
the minority was active but not dominant. Above 0.6 = heavy resistance from the minority.
Below 0.3 = the minority barely showed up.

---

**◈ climax line**

```
◈ climax: 57% ↑  aligned ✓
```

Of the most intense bars in your selection (top 25% by urgency), what fraction went up?
57% up here, with `aligned ✓` meaning the climax direction matches the overall count
direction. When climax direction and count direction disagree, this line turns orange —
one of the four divergence signals.

---

### Inline Suffixes: Instant Context

Every major metric line ends with a small interpretation tag. These are designed to
save you the mental translation step.

**Flow suffixes** (based on |IWDS|):

| Displayed       | What it means                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `← neutral`     | IWDS < 0.10: no meaningful directional loading          |
| `← lean`        | 0.10 – 0.30: slight bias, one direction slightly faster |
| `← bullish`     | 0.30 – 0.60: clear buy-side loading                     |
| `← bearish`     | 0.30 – 0.60: clear sell-side loading                    |
| `← strong bull` | > 0.60: dominant buy urgency                            |
| `← strong bear` | > 0.60: dominant sell urgency                           |

**CONTESTED near-miss** (appears as regime label, not a flow suffix):

```
CONTESTED — AUC 4pt below gate
```

IWDS was directional (above 0.15) but AUC missed the conviction threshold by 4 percentage
points. Almost convicted — worth watching on the next selection update.

**Urgency caption suffixes** (based on raw speed ratio):

| Displayed           | Ratio range | What it means                              |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `← marginal`        | < 1.2×      | Barely any speed difference — coin flip    |
| `← present`         | 1.2 – 1.5×  | Meaningful speed edge                      |
| `← structural edge` | > 1.5×      | One side consistently arriving much faster |

**P(↑>↓) AUC suffixes** (based on distance from 0.5):

| Displayed       | Distance from 0.5 | What it means                     |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `← weak edge`   | < 5 pts           | Near coin-flip in head-to-head    |
| `← moderate`    | 5 – 15 pts        | Consistent directional advantage  |
| `← strong edge` | > 15 pts          | Very consistent head-to-head wins |

**Absorption suffixes** (based on minority mean_t rank):

| Displayed             | Range       | What it means                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `← minority fading`   | < 0.30      | Losing side gave up — move met little resistance |
| `← minority active`   | 0.30 – 0.50 | Mixed — some resistance but not dominant         |
| `← minority fighting` | 0.50 – 0.65 | Losing side trading urgently — contested         |
| `← heavy pushback`    | > 0.65      | Strong resistance — potential absorption pattern |

**Climax alignment** (appended to the climax line when climax is not diverging):

```
◈ climax: 57% ↑  aligned ✓
```

`aligned ✓` = the climax direction (which side dominated the most intense moments)
matches the count direction (which side closed more bars). When they disagree, `aligned ✓`
disappears and the climax line turns orange — see Divergence Signals.

---

### The Regime Label

The regime label is the panel's single synthesized verdict. It sits prominently in the
display with a matching colored border on the stats box.

**BULL CONVICTION** (green border)

IWDS > 0.15 and AUC ≥ 0.60: both metrics agree that up-bars dominate. The intensity is
net positive and up-bars win head-to-head matchups consistently. This is not a prediction —
it describes what already happened. Can appear mid-trend (continuation) or at a top
(exhaustion). Use with chart context.

**BEAR CONVICTION** (red border)

Mirror of BULL CONVICTION. Sellers dominating intensity and head-to-head matchups.

**BULL ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split** (orange border)

IWDS > 0.15 (net buy intensity) but AUC < 0.50 (down-bars win more head-to-head matchups).
The two metrics are telling opposite stories — hence "flow/AUC split" in the label. Despite
more total urgency flowing through up-bars, a randomly picked down-bar was more intense
than a randomly picked up-bar. Classic absorption pattern: a few very intense buy bars
dominate the total, but the sellers are consistently matching or beating each individual
buy bar. Suspect the move.

**BEAR ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split** (orange border)

Mirror of BULL ABSORPTION. Net sell intensity but up-bars win more matchups.

**BULL CLIMAX ◈** (magenta border)

78% or more of the top-quartile-intensity bars (the most frenzied 25% of the selection)
were up-bars. This is checked before conviction — climax overrides everything because
concentrated intensity in one direction at the tail is a classic exhaustion signal.
The `◈` symbol marks this as a reversal-watch condition.

**BEAR CLIMAX ◈** (magenta border)

Mirror. 78%+ of the most frenzied bars were down-bars.

**CONTESTED** (no border)

No strong signal. IWDS is near zero, or AUC is near 50%, or both. The box has no colored
border by design — when there is no signal, the UI stays quiet.

**CONTESTED — AUC Npt below gate** (no border, but informative)

A special near-miss label: IWDS was directional (≥ 0.15 in magnitude) but AUC missed the
conviction threshold (0.60 for bull, 0.40 for bear) by N percentage points or fewer (where
N ≤ 12). The market is close to convinced — the slight AUC miss is worth noting. Example:
`CONTESTED — AUC 4pt below gate` means AUC was 0.56 when the bull conviction gate is 0.60.

---

### Divergence Signals

Divergence signals are the most actionable output from this panel. They fire when two
different measurements are telling opposite stories — a situation that tends to precede
reversals or at minimum indicates contested price discovery.

When a divergence is active, one or two `⚡` rows appear below the main metrics.

---

#### 1. CLIMAX DIVERGENCE (most important)

**What triggers it**: The most frenzied moments of your selection went against the
directional majority. Specifically: if more bars went up overall but the majority of the
top-25%-intensity bars went down — or vice versa.

**What it looks like** (climax line turns orange, plus two extra rows):

```
◈ climax: 65% ↓  (of top-25% bars)
⚡ DIVERGES: bears 65% of peak moments
   — vs bull count 60% overall
```

**Trading interpretation**: 60% of bars closed up. But the 4 most frenzied bars in the
selection were mostly down-bars. The market's most urgent moments went against the
directional majority. This is a classic pre-reversal microstructure fingerprint — buyers
are winning the vote but sellers are winning the intensity battles that matter most. The
market may be absorbing the move at the tail.

---

#### 2. URGENCY-COUNT SPLIT

**What triggers it**: The side arriving faster (higher mean t/s) is not the side that
won more bars.

**What it looks like**:

```
⚡ SPLIT: buyers faster, bears win more bars
```

or

```
⚡ SPLIT: sellers faster, bulls win more bars
```

**Trading interpretation**: Price action and execution speed are telling opposite stories.
Bears closed more bars — but buyers were arriving faster at the exchange. This means the
up moves, while fewer, were driven by more urgency. The market may be coiling. Alternatively
it can indicate weak bear bars being printed mechanically while buyers accumulate.

---

#### 3. FLOW/AUC SPLIT

**How it is surfaced**: this divergence is captured by the ABSORPTION regime label and
the CONTESTED near-miss label, rather than a separate `⚡` row.

When you see `BULL ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split` or `BEAR ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split`,
that IS the flow/AUC divergence signal. The `← flow/AUC split` suffix explains why
absorption was triggered.

When you see `CONTESTED — AUC Npt below gate`, the flow/AUC split almost fired — the
directional flow was present but AUC narrowly missed confirmation.

---

#### 4. CONV-ABSORP CONTEST

**What triggers it**: conviction > 1.5× AND absorption > 0.60 simultaneously. The
dominant side has a strong intensity edge — but the minority is fighting back at a
near-climactic level. Both sides are charging simultaneously.

**What it looks like**:

```
⚡ CONTESTED: high conv + heavy pushback
```

**Trading interpretation**: This is contested price discovery — the dominant side has
structural intensity advantage (1.5×+) but the minority is not fading. They are trading
urgently against the move. This combination often appears at key levels: a strong trend
bar meeting an order cluster, or a directional move being absorbed by a large participant.
It does not tell you who wins — only that both sides are fully engaged.

---

### Reading Patterns

These are common combinations and what they typically indicate. None of these is a
mechanical signal — use them to build context alongside price structure.

---

**Pattern 1: Clean continuation**

- BULL CONVICTION (green border)
- conv: > 1.3×, absorption: < 0.35
- No divergence signals
- climax: aligned ✓

Interpretation: the up-bars were both more numerous AND more intense, head-to-head wins
were consistent (AUC ≥ 0.60), the minority barely showed up (low absorption), and the
most frenzied moments were bullish. This is clean, low-resistance directional flow. Does
not predict the future but confirms the move was supported by urgency.

---

**Pattern 2: Absorption at a level**

- BULL ABSORPTION (orange border) or BEAR ABSORPTION
- conv: < 1.0 (majority direction less intense than minority)
- absorption: > 0.60
- urgency caption: "sellers 1.8× more urgent" despite majority up

Interpretation: the move is going in one direction by bar count but the intensity is
loading into the other side. A large participant may be absorbing the dominant flow —
they are taking the other side with urgency. This is a warning to reduce size or tighten
stops on the dominant side. Classic iceberg or stop-defense behavior.

---

**Pattern 3: Climax exhaustion setup**

- BULL CLIMAX ◈ or BEAR CLIMAX ◈ (magenta border)
- climax: 80–100% in one direction
- ⚡ DIVERGES row present (climax direction opposing count direction)

Interpretation: the most frenzied moments were all concentrated in one direction. When
climax direction matches count direction, the move was intense throughout — potentially
extended. When climax direction opposes count (the ⚡ DIVERGES case), the market's
most urgent moments went against the majority — a classic reversal fingerprint.

---

**Pattern 4: Coiling / contested zone**

- CONTESTED or CONTESTED — AUC Npt below gate
- ⚡ SPLIT: one side faster, other side wins more bars
- conv: near 1.0
- absorption: 0.40 – 0.60

Interpretation: no clear intensity edge in either direction. The market is balanced. If
you also see the urgency-count split, the two simplest measurements (bar count and trade
speed) disagree — classic consolidation before a directional break.

---

**Pattern 5: Trend with resistance building**

- BULL CONVICTION (green border)
- conv: > 1.3× (majority direction dominant)
- absorption: > 0.60 (but not high enough to flip to absorption regime)
- ⚡ CONTESTED: high conv + heavy pushback

Interpretation: the dominant side has a real edge, but the minority is fighting back hard.
This often appears as a trend approaching a key level. The conviction side has momentum,
the minority is defending. Watch for the absorption value to creep higher — if it crosses
the regime gate on the next selection, the picture has shifted.

---

**Pattern 6: Hollow bull move**

- 60–70% bars up, BULL CONVICTION on bar count
- flow: ← neutral or ← lean (IWDS near zero)
- P(↑>↓): ← weak edge (AUC near 50%)
- conv: < 1.0

Interpretation: more bars went up, but the intensity does not support the direction.
The up-bars were no more urgent than the down-bars. This is a weak move — it may be
engineered (passive buy orders filling against urgent sellers) or simply drifting through
thin air. A more convincing move in either direction would show intensity matching count.

---

### Prediction Checklist

Step-by-step method for reading the panel in real time:

**Step 1: Check the header counts.**
Is there a clear directional majority? A 70/30 split is meaningful. A 55/45 split is
not by itself.

**Step 2: Check the regime label and its color.**

- Green/red border = strong signal, both metrics agree
- Orange border = divergence, treat the direction with caution
- Magenta border = climax condition, watch for exhaustion
- No border = no clear signal

**Step 3: Check the flow suffix.**
Is the intensity loading into the majority direction (aligned) or the minority (divergent)?
`← strong bull` on a bearish-count selection is a warning.

**Step 4: Check P(↑>↓) and its suffix.**
Is `← strong edge` present? This means up-bars won consistently in head-to-head — not
just in total volume. A `← weak edge` on a bullish-count selection means intensity is
actually balanced.

**Step 5: Check conviction and absorption together.**

- conv > 1.5 + absorption < 0.30: dominant side overwhelming, little resistance — clean
- conv > 1.5 + absorption > 0.60: dominant side strong but contested — ⚡ CONTESTED fires
- conv < 1.0 + absorption > 0.60: intensity loading against direction — absorption pattern

**Step 6: Check the climax line.**
Is `aligned ✓` present? If not, and the climax percentage is high, look for the
⚡ DIVERGES signal.

**Step 7: Count the ⚡ rows.**
Zero divergence signals: situation is internally consistent — act with the regime label.
One signal: one dimension is contradicting the others — reduce confidence.
Two or more signals: multiple measurements disagreeing — treat as contested regardless
of the regime label. Wait for the situation to resolve.

## Technical Reference

This section contains exact formulas, code locations, thresholds, and rendering details.

## 1. What This Feature Does (Plain Terms)

When you select a range of ODB bars by Shift-clicking on the chart, a small statistics
overlay appears at the top-center of the chart pane. You already see the obvious counts
— how many bars went up, how many went down, and their percentages. But the overlay
goes much further.

It asks a more interesting question: **was the buying urgent or lazy compared to the
selling?**

A bar moving up with 200 trades per second arriving at the exchange is a very different
event from a bar moving up with 5 trades per second. The first is contested, frantic,
potentially climactic. The second is a slow drift through thin air. Both close higher —
but the microstructure story is opposite.

The overlay computes seven statistical metrics that each illuminate a different facet of
that question, then synthesises them into a single **regime label** that captures the
dominant pattern: conviction, absorption, climax, or contested.

**Example read**: You select 20 bars following a sharp move up. The overlay shows
`BULL ABSORPTION`. This means: yes, more bars closed up, but the intensity was actually
loading into the down-bars — sellers were fighting more urgently than buyers.
Classic divergence before a reversal.

---

## 2. Data Source and Prerequisites

### Where `trade_intensity` Lives

Every completed ODB bar carries an `OdbMicrostructure` struct embedded in its
`TickAccumulation`:

```rust
// data/src/aggr/ticks.rs
pub struct OdbMicrostructure {
    pub trade_intensity: f32,  // trades / second over this bar's duration
    pub ofi: f32,              // order-flow imbalance [-1, +1]
}
```

`trade_intensity` is the number of individual Binance `@aggTrade` events that arrived
during the bar, divided by the bar's duration in seconds. A bar that lasted 3 seconds
and contained 600 trades has intensity 200.0 t/s.

The raw value originates in ClickHouse — it is a column in
`opendeviationbar_cache.open_deviation_bars` precomputed by the opendeviationbar-py
pipeline. It is deserialized through `ChMicrostructure.trade_intensity: Option<f64>`
and stored as `f32` on the Rust side.

Bars without microstructure (e.g. the live forming bar, or bars loaded before the
pipeline ran) have `microstructure = None`. The collection step maps these to
`raw = 0.0` via `map_or(0.0, |m| m.trade_intensity)`.

### What "t/s" Means in Context

`trade_intensity` is an **absolute** rate. It is session-dependent by construction:
during the New York open, even slow moves can show 80 t/s because the market is busy.
During the Asian session, a fast move might only show 15 t/s. The overlay's design
accounts for this wherever possible — rank-normalized metrics (`↑t`, `↓t`, conviction,
absorption) are session-independent because they normalize within the selection. Metrics
that use raw values (`log₂` ratio, IWDS) also cancel session baseline naturally, as
explained in §5.

### ODB-Only Feature

This overlay only renders when the chart's `PlotData` is `TickBased` (i.e. when the
chart is an ODB pane, `Basis::Odb(_)` or `Basis::Tick(_)`). Time-series charts
(`TimeBased`) do not have per-bar `OdbMicrostructure` and the function is not called
for them.

---

## 3. Triggering: Bar Range Selection

### User Interaction

The selection is created using **Shift+Left Click** on the chart canvas:

- **First Shift-click**: sets the anchor bar.
- **Second Shift-click** (different bar): sets the end bar. The overlay appears.
- **Third Shift-click**: resets — the clicked bar becomes the new anchor.
- **Click on the outermost bar of an existing selection** (the "brim"): drag mode —
  move that boundary while keeping the other fixed.
- **Left-drag on the stats box**: repositions the floating overlay anywhere on screen.
  The position is reset to top-center on the third Shift-click (selection restart).

The anchor and end are stored in `BarSelectionState` (wrapped in `RefCell<T>` for
interior mutability, since `canvas::Program::update()` takes `&self`). Both are
`usize` visual indices (newest = 0).

### Function Signature and Coordinate Conversion

```rust
fn draw_bar_selection_stats(
    frame: &mut canvas::Frame,
    palette: &Extended,
    tick_aggr: &data::aggr::ticks::TickAggr,
    anchor: usize,
    end: usize,
    stats_box_pos: Option<iced::Point>,
)
```

`anchor` and `end` are visual indices (newest bar = 0). The `tick_aggr.datapoints`
Vec uses **storage indices** (oldest bar = 0). Conversion is:

```
storage_idx = len - 1 - visual_idx
```

The function computes `(lo, hi) = (anchor.min(end), anchor.max(end))` so that the
range is always valid regardless of which end the user clicked first. `hi` is then
clamped to `len - 1`.

`distance = hi - lo` is the number of bar-gaps between the two endpoints. A selection
of a single bar has `distance = 0`; two adjacent bars have `distance = 1`.

`stats_box_pos` is the user-dragged top-left position of the stats box, or `None` to
use the default top-center position.

### Render Layer

The function is called inside the **`legend` cache layer** in `kline.rs`. This layer
is screen-space (no chart translation or scaling applied), and is invalidated on every
cursor move — making it efficient for interactive overlays that update with drag.
The heavy `main` cache (candle bodies) is not touched during selection.

---

## 4. Data Collection: `BarSample`

The first step is collecting the raw data for all bars in the selection:

```rust
struct BarSample {
    raw: f32,    // trade_intensity in t/s (0.0 if no microstructure)
    is_up: bool, // close >= open
}

let bars: Vec<BarSample> = (lo..=hi)
    .map(|vi| {
        let si = len - 1 - vi;
        let dp = &tick_aggr.datapoints[si];
        BarSample {
            raw: dp.microstructure.map_or(0.0, |m| m.trade_intensity),
            is_up: dp.kline.close >= dp.kline.open,
        }
    })
    .collect();
```

After collection:

```rust
let n = bars.len();
let n_up = bars.iter().filter(|b| b.is_up).count();
let n_dn = n - n_up;
let up_pct = n_up as f32 / n as f32 * 100.0;
let dn_pct = n_dn as f32 / n as f32 * 100.0;
```

"Up bar" is defined as `close >= open` — a doji (open == close) counts as up. This
matches the candle body color convention used throughout the chart.

---

## 5. The Seven Metrics

### 5.1 — Within-Selection Rank Normalization (`↑t` / `↓t`)

**Plain explanation**: On a scale of 0 to 1, how intense were the up-bars compared to
the down-bars, relative to the other bars in this specific selection? A value of 0.68
for `↑t` means up-bars were, on average, in the top 32% of intensity within this window.
You do not need to memorize any absolute trade rate — the comparison is always to the
other bars you selected.

**Technical specification**:

A sorted index `order` is computed once and reused by both rank normalization and the
AUC calculation (§5.3):

```rust
let mut order: Vec<usize> = (0..n).collect();
order.sort_unstable_by(|&a, &b| {
    bars[a].raw.partial_cmp(&bars[b].raw).unwrap_or(std::cmp::Ordering::Equal)
});
```

Rank normalization with tie handling:

```rust
let mut rank_norm = vec![0.5_f32; n];
if n > 1 {
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < n {
        let mut j = i;
        while j + 1 < n && (bars[order[j + 1]].raw - bars[order[i]].raw).abs() < 1e-6 {
            j += 1;
        }
        // Ties get average rank
        let avg = (i + j) as f32 * 0.5 / (n - 1) as f32;
        for k in i..=j {
            rank_norm[order[k]] = avg;
        }
        i = j + 1;
    }
}
```

- Bars are ranked 0.0 (coldest in selection) to 1.0 (hottest in selection).
- Ties receive the average of their position range: e.g. if positions 3 and 4 (0-indexed)
  both have the same raw intensity and n=10, both get `(3+4)/2 / 9 = 0.389`.
- With n=1, `rank_norm` defaults to `[0.5]` — the sole bar is at the midpoint.

Per-direction means of rank_norm:

```rust
let mean_t_up = if n_up > 0 { sum_t_up / n_up as f32 } else { f32::NAN };
let mean_t_dn = if n_dn > 0 { sum_t_dn / n_dn as f32 } else { f32::NAN };
```

**Display format**: `↑t 0.68  ↑ 124 t/s` — the rank-normalized mean followed by the raw
trades-per-second mean in parentheses. Both numbers on the same line.

**Session independence**: because normalization reference is the selection itself,
a Monday NY-session selection and a Sunday overnight selection are directly comparable.
`↑t = 0.68` in both cases means "up-bars were in the 68th percentile of intensity
within their own window" — regardless of whether that was 200 t/s or 15 t/s in absolute terms.

**Edge cases**:

- `n_up = 0`: `mean_t_up = NaN` → displayed as `—`
- `n_dn = 0`: `mean_t_dn = NaN` → displayed as `—`
- `n = 1`: `rank_norm[0] = 0.5`, so `↑t` or `↓t` shows `0.50`

---

### 5.2 — IWDS: Intensity-Weighted Direction Score (`flow`)

**Plain explanation**: Imagine giving each bar a vote of +1 (up) or -1 (down), but
weighting heavier (more intense) bars more. What is the net weighted score? A score of
+0.42 means 42% more of the total trading urgency was on buy-side bars. 0.0 is perfectly
neutral; +1.0 means every single trade happened during up-bars; -1.0 means every trade
happened during down-bars.

**Technical specification**:

```rust
let total_raw: f32 = bars.iter().map(|b| b.raw).sum();
let iwds = if total_raw > 0.0 {
    bars.iter()
        .map(|b| b.raw * if b.is_up { 1.0 } else { -1.0 })
        .sum::<f32>() / total_raw
} else {
    0.0
};
```

Expanded: `iwds = (Σ raw_i for up-bars − Σ raw_i for dn-bars) / Σ raw_i`

Range: `[-1.0, +1.0]`.

- `+1.0`: all trade intensity on up-bars (100% bull urgency)
- `-1.0`: all trade intensity on down-bars (100% bear urgency)
- `0.0`: equal intensity on both sides, or all bars have intensity 0.0

**Session baseline cancellation**: if all bars are in the same session and every bar's
intensity is scaled by a common factor α (e.g. the NY open multiplier), the IWDS is
unchanged: `α × sum_up / (α × sum_up + α × sum_dn) = sum_up / (sum_up + sum_dn)`.
Cross-session comparisons of IWDS are therefore meaningful.

**Relation to per-bar OFI**: the per-bar `OdbMicrostructure.ofi` field is
`(buy_vol − sell_vol) / total_vol` — order-flow imbalance at the trade level within
a single bar. IWDS is the analogous computation at the bar level across a selection:
it aggregates the directional urgency of bars themselves rather than of individual trades
within a bar.

**Literature**: the IWDS formulation is analogous to the order-flow imbalance metric
in Cont, Kukanov & Stoikov (2014), aggregated at bar granularity.

**Display**: `[██████░░░░]  flow: +0.42  ← bullish` — the ASCII bar visualizes the IWDS value
(see §9 for details), followed by the numeric value with sign, and an inline suffix.

**Inline suffixes** (based on `iwds.abs()`):

| Range       | Suffix                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| < 0.10      | `← neutral`                       |
| 0.10 – 0.30 | `← lean`                          |
| 0.30 – 0.60 | `← bullish` / `← bearish`         |
| ≥ 0.60      | `← strong bull` / `← strong bear` |

---

### 5.3 — Mann-Whitney AUC: `P(↑>↓)`

**Plain explanation**: If you randomly picked one up-bar and one down-bar from your
selection and compared their trade intensities, what is the probability that the up-bar
would have higher intensity? 73% means up-bars won 73% of head-to-head matchups.
50% means no directional edge at all — up and down bars are equally intense.
This is the most outlier-resistant of all the metrics: a single frenzied 500 t/s bar
counts as rank N, not as 500 times more weight.

**Technical specification**:

The Mann-Whitney U statistic is computed from the `order` sorted index that was already
computed for rank normalization — no second sort is needed:

```rust
let auc: f32 = if n_up > 0 && n_dn > 0 {
    // Sum 1-indexed ranks of up-bars in the sorted order
    let r_up: f32 = order.iter().enumerate()
        .filter(|(_, orig)| bars[**orig].is_up)
        .map(|(rank_0, _)| rank_0 as f32 + 1.0)
        .sum();
    let u_up = r_up - n_up as f32 * (n_up as f32 + 1.0) / 2.0;
    u_up / (n_up as f32 * n_dn as f32)
} else {
    f32::NAN
};
```

The rank-sum `r_up` is the sum of 1-indexed ranks of all up-bars in the globally sorted
order. `u_up = r_up − n_up(n_up+1)/2` is the Mann-Whitney U statistic. Dividing by
`n_up × n_dn` normalizes to the AUC interpretation: the probability that a randomly
chosen up-bar has higher intensity than a randomly chosen down-bar.

**Properties**:

- Range: `[0.0, 1.0]`. 0.5 = no directional edge.
- `AUC = 1.0`: every up-bar was more intense than every down-bar.
- `AUC = 0.0`: every down-bar was more intense than every up-bar.
- **Outlier resistant**: extreme values contribute only their rank, not their magnitude.
  A 500 t/s bar counts as rank N whether it's 200 t/s or 2000 t/s above the next bar.
- **Distribution-free**: no assumption about normality or any other distribution.
  Trade intensity is right-skewed (skewness ≈ 322 on BPR25); rank-based tests are
  robust to this.

**Complexity**: O(N log N) for the initial sort, then O(N) for the rank-sum. No
additional sort pass because `order` is shared with rank normalization.

**Literature**: Mann & Whitney (1947). The AUC interpretation of the U statistic
is described in Hanley & McNeil (1982).

**Edge cases**:

- `n_up = 0` or `n_dn = 0`: `auc = f32::NAN` → displayed as `—`

**Display format**: `P(↑>↓): 73%   log₂: +0.74  ← moderate`

**Inline suffixes** (based on `(auc - 0.5).abs()`):

| Distance from 0.5 | Suffix          |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| < 0.05            | `← weak edge`   |
| 0.05 – 0.15       | `← moderate`    |
| ≥ 0.15            | `← strong edge` |

---

### 5.4 — Log₂ Ratio: `log₂(↑/↓)`

**Plain explanation**: How many doublings of intensity advantage do up-bars have over
down-bars, in terms of raw trades per second? +1.0 means buyers were exactly 2× more
intense. -1.0 means sellers were 2× more intense. 0.0 means equal. +2.0 would mean
buyers were 4× more intense. The symmetric scale makes it easy to compare: +1.5 bears
is the same "distance from neutral" as +1.5 bulls.

**Technical specification**:

```rust
let log2_ratio = if mean_raw_up > 0.0 && mean_raw_dn > 0.0 {
    (mean_raw_up / mean_raw_dn).log2()
} else {
    f32::NAN
};
```

where `mean_raw_up` and `mean_raw_dn` are the arithmetic means of raw `trade_intensity`
(in t/s) for each direction's bars.

**Properties**:

- Range: `(-∞, +∞)`. Typical observed range: approximately `[-3, +3]`.
- Symmetric: `log₂(2/1) = +1.0` and `log₂(1/2) = -1.0` have equal magnitude.
  Compare to raw ratio: 2.0 vs 0.5 appear very different in scale.
- **Session baseline cancels in the ratio**: if all bars' intensities are α× higher
  (e.g. during NY open), `α × mean_up / α × mean_dn = mean_up / mean_dn`.
  The log₂ ratio is therefore session-independent.
- Uses raw means (not rank-normalized), allowing the metric to reflect true magnitude
  differences, not just rank order.

**Edge cases**:

- `mean_raw_up = 0.0` or `mean_raw_dn = 0.0` (bars with no microstructure data):
  `log2_ratio = f32::NAN` → displayed as `—`

**Display format**: `log₂: +0.74` (formatted as `lg2_s(v)` = `format!("{v:+.2}")`).
Displayed on the same line as `P(↑>↓)` with the shared AUC suffix.

---

### 5.5 — Conviction Ratio (`conv`)

**Plain explanation**: Is the "winning direction" (the one with more bars) also the
more urgently traded direction? Conviction > 1.0 means yes — the majority direction
was also more intense, suggesting the move has real urgency behind it. Conviction < 1.0
is an early exhaustion warning — the majority direction actually had _lower_ intensity
than the minority, meaning the market is moving more bars in one direction but the
urgency is loading into the other side.

**Technical specification**:

```rust
let dominant_up = n_up >= n_dn;
let conviction = if dominant_up {
    if !mean_t_dn.is_nan() && mean_t_dn > 0.0 { mean_t_up / mean_t_dn } else { f32::NAN }
} else {
    if !mean_t_up.is_nan() && mean_t_up > 0.0 { mean_t_dn / mean_t_up } else { f32::NAN }
};
```

`conviction` is always `mean_t(dominant_direction) / mean_t(minority_direction)`,
using rank-normalized t values.

**Interpretation**:

- `conv > 1.0`: dominant direction is more intense. "Trend has intensity fuel."
- `conv = 1.0`: both directions equally intense.
- `conv < 1.0`: minority direction is more intense. "Intensity loading against trend."
  Combined with `BULL ABSORPTION` or `BEAR ABSORPTION` regime, this is a classic
  exhaustion / divergence signal.
- `dominant_up = true` if `n_up >= n_dn` (ties go to up).

**Why rank-normalized?**: uses `mean_t_up` / `mean_t_dn` (rank-normalized) rather than
`mean_raw_up` / `mean_raw_dn` (absolute), making the conviction ratio session-independent.
A conviction of 1.85 means the same structural relationship at 2 AM and 9:30 AM.

**Edge cases**:

- Only one direction present: `conviction = f32::NAN` → displayed as `—`
- `mean_t_dn = 0.0` (all down-bars have zero intensity): `conviction = f32::NAN`

**Display format**: `conv: 1.85×   absorp: 0.41  ← minority active`

---

### 5.6 — Absorption (`absorp`)

**Plain explanation**: How hard was the losing side fighting? This metric shows the
average intensity rank of the _minority-direction_ bars — the side that closed fewer
bars. High absorption (> 0.6) means the losing side was urgently contested — it did
not give up easily. This pattern is associated with absorption of dominant flow by
large participants (icebergs, stop-hunt defense). Low absorption (< 0.3) means the
minority bars were lazy — the market moved through a vacuum with little opposition,
which often means the trend is sustainable.

**Technical specification**:

```rust
let absorption = if dominant_up { mean_t_dn } else { mean_t_up };
```

`absorption` is simply `mean_t` of the minority-direction bars. It is the rank-normalized
mean intensity of bars that closed against the dominant trend.

**Important nuance**: absorption is the mean*t of whichever direction has \_fewer bars*,
not necessarily the down-bars. In a selection with more down-bars than up-bars, absorption
shows the mean_t of the up-bars (the minority).

**Interpretation by threshold**:

- `> 0.65`: heavy pushback — minority bars were in the top 35% of intensity.
  Suggests active defense, absorption of flow, iceberg orders, or stop-hunting.
- `0.50 – 0.65`: minority fighting — contested, neither side collapsed.
- `0.30 – 0.50`: minority active — some resistance, mixed signal.
- `< 0.30`: minority fading — minority bars drifted. The move has little opposition;
  the trend may continue.

**Edge cases**:

- Only one direction present: `absorption = f32::NAN` (because the relevant `mean_t` is NaN)
  → displayed as `—`

**Display format**: `absorp: 0.41` (formatted as `t_s(v)` = `format!("{v:.2}")`).
Displayed on the same line as `conv` with the absorption suffix.

**Inline suffixes** (based on `absorption` value):

| Range       | Suffix                |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| < 0.30      | `← minority fading`   |
| 0.30 – 0.50 | `← minority active`   |
| 0.50 – 0.65 | `← minority fighting` |
| ≥ 0.65      | `← heavy pushback`    |

---

### 5.7 — Climax Concentration (`◈ climax`)

**Plain explanation**: Of the most frenzied bars in your selection — the top 25% by
intensity within the selection — what fraction went in the up direction? 80% ↑ means
that buyers dominated the most urgent moments of this window. This is the "climax"
metric because concentrating the most intense action in one direction is a classic
climactic pattern: the move has exhausted its most urgent participants, and reversals
often follow. An even split (near 50%) means the most frenzied moments were balanced.

**Technical specification**:

```rust
let (top_n, top_up) = bars.iter().enumerate()
    .filter(|(i, _)| rank_norm[*i] > 0.75)
    .fold((0_usize, 0_usize), |(t, u), (_, b)| {
        (t + 1, if b.is_up { u + 1 } else { u })
    });
let climax_up_frac = if top_n > 0 { top_up as f32 / top_n as f32 } else { f32::NAN };
```

The top quartile is defined as `rank_norm[i] > 0.75` (strict inequality — the 75th
percentile threshold, within-selection). `climax_up_frac` is the fraction of those
top-quartile bars that are up-bars.

**Display logic**: the displayed direction always shows the dominant direction in the tail:

```rust
let (frac, dir) = if climax_up_frac >= 0.5 {
    (climax_up_frac, "↑")
} else {
    (1.0 - climax_up_frac, "↓")
};
format!("◈ climax: {:.0}% {dir}  (of top-25% bars)", frac * 100.0)
```

So `climax_up_frac = 0.20` displays as `◈ climax: 80% ↓  (of top-25% bars)`.

**Alignment suffix**:

```rust
let climax_suffix = if !climax_up_frac.is_nan() && !climax_divergence { "  aligned ✓" } else { "" };
```

`aligned ✓` is appended when the climax direction matches the overall count direction
(i.e. no climax divergence is active). It is omitted when `climax_divergence` fires
(the ⚡ DIVERGES rows appear instead).

**Regime thresholds**:

- `≥ 0.78` (78% of top-quartile bars are up): `BULL CLIMAX ◈`
- `≤ 0.22` (78% of top-quartile bars are down): `BEAR CLIMAX ◈`
- Otherwise: no climax regime triggered from this metric alone

**Color**: orange when `climax_divergence` is active or when the regime has a border
(indicating a non-CONTESTED result). `amber_dim` otherwise.

**Why 75th percentile?**: the top quartile by within-selection rank gives a stable
"tail" sample. Using the top decile (90th) would leave too few bars in short selections.
Using the top half would dilute the signal into the median.

**Edge cases**:

- No bars with `rank_norm > 0.75`: can occur when n is very small (e.g. 2-3 bars
  with all having the same intensity, so all ranks are equal). Displays as:
  `◈ climax: — (no top-25% bars yet)`
- `n = 1`: `rank_norm[0] = 0.5`, so it does not exceed 0.75. Displays as `—`.

---

## 6. Divergence Detection Logic

Four divergence signals are computed after the main metrics. Each produces one or two
`⚡` rows appended to the main display lines. Box height is dynamic — it grows to
accommodate the extra rows.

### 6.1 — Climax Divergence

```rust
let climax_divergence = !climax_up_frac.is_nan()
    && (n_up >= n_dn) != (climax_up_frac >= 0.5);
```

Fires when the peak-intensity direction (climax) opposes the overall bar-count direction.

**Rendered rows** (orange):

```
⚡ DIVERGES: bears 65% of peak moments
   — vs bull count 60% overall
```

The first row states which side dominated the peak-intensity moments and by what
percentage. The second row states the overall count direction and percentage for comparison.
The climax line itself also turns orange when this fires.

### 6.2 — Urgency-Count Split

```rust
let urgency_count_diverge = !mean_raw_up.is_nan() && !mean_raw_dn.is_nan()
    && (n_up >= n_dn) != (mean_raw_up >= mean_raw_dn);
```

Fires when the side arriving faster (higher mean raw t/s) is not the side that won more bars.

**Rendered row** (orange):

```
⚡ SPLIT: buyers faster, bears win more bars
```

or

```
⚡ SPLIT: sellers faster, bulls win more bars
```

### 6.3 — Flow/AUC Split

This divergence is surfaced via the regime label and CONTESTED near-miss, not a separate
`⚡` row.

**ABSORPTION regime** (`BULL/BEAR ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split`): fires when IWDS and AUC
point in opposite directions. The `← flow/AUC split` suffix in the regime label explains
the cause.

**CONTESTED near-miss** (computed inside the `Regime::Contested` branch):

```rust
let near_miss = if iwds > 0.15 && !auc.is_nan() {
    let g = (0.60 - auc) * 100.0;
    if g > 0.0 && g <= 12.0 { Some(g) } else { None }
} else if iwds < -0.15 && !auc.is_nan() {
    let g = (auc - 0.40) * 100.0;
    if g > 0.0 && g <= 12.0 { Some(g) } else { None }
} else { None };
let label = match near_miss {
    Some(g) => format!("CONTESTED — AUC {g:.0}pt below gate"),
    None    => "CONTESTED".into(),
};
```

The gap `g` is computed in percentage points. A gap ≤ 12 points (e.g. AUC = 0.56 when
the bull conviction gate is 0.60) produces the near-miss label.

### 6.4 — Conv-Absorp Contest

```rust
let conv_absorp_contest = !conviction.is_nan() && !absorption.is_nan()
    && conviction > 1.5 && absorption > 0.60;
```

Fires when conviction > 1.5× AND absorption > 0.60 simultaneously.

**Rendered row** (orange):

```
⚡ CONTESTED: high conv + heavy pushback
```

---

## 7. Regime Classification Rules

After computing all seven metrics, a single `Regime` enum is determined. This is the
synthesized "verdict" that combines multiple metrics into a human-readable label.

### Priority Order

Regime classification uses a priority-ordered `if / else if` chain. **Climax is checked
first** — it overrides conviction signals because climax is a forward-looking reversal
warning that supersedes the current directional story.

```rust
enum Regime {
    BullConviction, BearConviction,
    BullAbsorption, BearAbsorption,
    BullClimax, BearClimax,
    Contested
}

let regime = if !climax_up_frac.is_nan() && climax_up_frac >= 0.78 {
    Regime::BullClimax
} else if !climax_up_frac.is_nan() && climax_up_frac <= 0.22 {
    Regime::BearClimax
} else if iwds > 0.15 && !auc.is_nan() && auc >= 0.60 {
    Regime::BullConviction
} else if iwds < -0.15 && !auc.is_nan() && auc <= 0.40 {
    Regime::BearConviction
} else if iwds > 0.15 && !auc.is_nan() && auc < 0.50 {
    Regime::BullAbsorption
} else if iwds < -0.15 && !auc.is_nan() && auc > 0.50 {
    Regime::BearAbsorption
} else {
    Regime::Contested
}
```

### Regime Table

| Regime            | Condition                   | Color                     | Border         | Label text                                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `BULL CONVICTION` | IWDS > 0.15 AND AUC ≥ 0.60  | `palette.success` (green) | green (0.65a)  | `BULL CONVICTION`                               |
| `BEAR CONVICTION` | IWDS < -0.15 AND AUC ≤ 0.40 | `palette.danger` (red)    | red (0.65a)    | `BEAR CONVICTION`                               |

| `BEAR ABSORPTION` | IWDS < -0.15 AND AUC > 0.50 | orange (0.95,0.55,0.10)   | orange(0.65a)  | `BEAR ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split`              |

| `BEAR CLIMAX ◈`   | climax_up_frac ≤ 0.22       | magenta (0.90,0.25,0.80)  | magenta(0.65a) | `BEAR CLIMAX ◈`                                 |
| `CONTESTED`       | All others                  | dim grey (0.50,0.50,0.50) | none           | `CONTESTED` or `CONTESTED — AUC Npt below gate` |

### Regime Deep-Dive: Conviction

`BULL CONVICTION` requires IWDS > 0.15 (net intensity loading onto up-bars) **and**
AUC ≥ 0.60 (up-bars win at least 60% of head-to-head matchups). Both metrics must
agree. This double confirmation reduces false positives: IWDS can be gamed by a single
massive bar, but AUC measures rank-order consistency across all bars.

A conviction reading does _not_ predict the future — it describes what just happened.
A selection of strong conviction bars during a trend could be mid-trend (consistent
with continuation) or at the end of a leg (the strongest bars often mark exhaustion).
Use conviction in conjunction with the chart pattern.

### Regime Deep-Dive: Absorption

`BULL ABSORPTION` means: despite more net intensity on up-bars (IWDS > 0.15), a random
down-bar is actually _more likely_ to beat a random up-bar in intensity (AUC < 0.50).
This is the hallmark of absorption: the dominant direction (by bar count or by total
intensity) is facing concentrated resistance from the minority.

In orderbook microstructure terms: a large participant may be absorbing the up-side
flow — taking the other side of every up-bar with equal or greater urgency, and closing
small down-bars in the process. The market appears to be going up but the intensity
tells a different story.

The label now reads `BULL ABSORPTION ← flow/AUC split` to make the diagnostic explicit:
the ABSORPTION regime always means IWDS and AUC are pointing in opposite directions.

### Regime Deep-Dive: Climax

`BULL CLIMAX ◈` fires when 78% or more of the top-quartile-intensity bars within the
selection are up-bars. This means the most frenzied moments of the window were dominated
by buying. Climax takes priority over conviction because even a strongly "convincing"
move can be at its exhaustion point if all the urgency is in one direction at the tail.

The `◈` symbol (used in the regime label and the climax line) is a diamond-shaped
indicator borrowing from Japanese candlestick tradition where concentrated "doji" activity
at a peak signals reversal potential.

### Regime Deep-Dive: Contested

`CONTESTED` is the null hypothesis — no strong reading from intensity alone. This covers
selections where:

- IWDS is between -0.15 and +0.15 (nearly neutral)
- AUC was NaN (only one direction present)
- AUC is between 0.40 and 0.60 (no directional intensity edge)
- The climax fraction was between 0.22 and 0.78

A `CONTESTED` selection does not have a colored border — the box is drawn without a
stroke, making it visually quieter. This is a deliberate design choice: when there is
no signal, the UI should not shout.

## 8. ASCII Intensity Bar

The intensity bar is a 10-character ASCII visualization of IWDS:

```rust
let fill = ((5.0 + iwds * 5.0).round() as usize).clamp(0, 10);
let bar_str = format!("[{}{}]", "█".repeat(fill), "░".repeat(10 - fill));
```

| IWDS | `fill` | Display        |
| ---- | ------ | -------------- |
| +1.0 | 10     | `[██████████]` |
| +0.6 | 8      | `[████████░░]` |
| +0.2 | 6      | `[██████░░░░]` |
| 0.0  | 5      | `[█████░░░░░]` |
| -0.2 | 4      | `[████░░░░░░]` |
| -0.6 | 2      | `[██░░░░░░░░]` |
| -1.0 | 0      | `[░░░░░░░░░░]` |

The center (5 filled blocks) corresponds to IWDS = 0. Left-heavy → sell dominant.
Right-heavy → buy dominant. This gives an immediate visual before reading any number.
It appears on the same line as the IWDS numeric value and flow suffix:
`[██████░░░░]  flow: +0.22  ← lean`.

---

## 9. Plain-English Caption

Below the regime label, a one-line human-readable caption provides a direct verbal
summary:

```rust
let caption = if !mean_raw_up.is_nan() && !mean_raw_dn.is_nan()
    && mean_raw_dn > 0.0 && mean_raw_up > 0.0
{
    let (dom, min_raw) = if mean_raw_up >= mean_raw_dn {
        (mean_raw_up, mean_raw_dn)
    } else {
        (mean_raw_dn, mean_raw_up)
    };
    let side = if mean_raw_up >= mean_raw_dn { "buyers" } else { "sellers" };
    format!("{side} {:.1}× more urgent", dom / min_raw)
} else if n_dn == 0 {
    "all bars bullish — no dn comparison".to_string()
} else {
    "all bars bearish — no up comparison".to_string()
};
```

Examples:

- `"buyers 1.8× more urgent"` — mean raw intensity of up-bars is 1.8× that of down-bars
- `"sellers 2.3× more urgent"` — down-bars averaged 2.3× more t/s than up-bars
- `"all bars bullish — no dn comparison"` — the selection contains only up-bars
- `"all bars bearish — no up comparison"` — the selection contains only down-bars

The caption uses raw means (not rank-normalized) so the multiple is in the same units as
the t/s values shown in `↑t` / `↓t` lines. Color: `dim_white` (0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.65).

An urgency suffix follows the caption on the same line:

**Urgency caption suffixes** (based on `dom / min_raw`):

| Ratio range | Suffix              |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| < 1.2×      | `← marginal`        |
| 1.2 – 1.5×  | `← present`         |
| ≥ 1.5×      | `← structural edge` |

### Box Geometry

```
Stats box outer width:  STATS_BOX_W = 286.0 px  (box_w + 2 × padding = 270 + 16)
Inner box_w:            270.0 px
Default position:       frame.width() / 2.0 - STATS_BOX_W / 2.0, y=6.0 (top-center)
User-dragged position:  stats_box_pos field in BarSelectionState
Padding:                x + 8.0 (left), y + 4.0 (top)
Background:             (0.07, 0.07, 0.07, 0.92) — near-black, near-opaque
Border:                 1.5 px stroke, border_col at alpha 0.65 (only when regime != CONTESTED)
```

Height is computed dynamically:

```rust
let lh_main = ts + 5.0;  // ts=13.0 → 18.0 px per main-size line
let lh_sm   = sm + 4.0;  // sm=11.0 → 15.0 px per small-size line
let total_h: f32 = lh_main          // header row
    + 3.0                           // separator
    + lh_sm                         // ↑t/↓t combined row
    + lines.iter()
        .map(|(_, _, sz)| if (*sz - ts).abs() < 0.5 { lh_main } else { lh_sm })
        .sum::<f32>()
    + 12.0;                         // top/bottom padding
```

The `lines` Vec is built from fixed rows plus conditionally appended divergence rows,
so total height varies between selections.

| ⚡ div (0-3) | 11px | `⚡ DIVERGES: bears 65% of peak moments` etc.      | orange / dim           |

Divergence rows are appended to the `lines` Vec in this order (when active):

1. Climax divergence (up to 2 rows: signal + detail)
2. Urgency-count split (1 row)
3. Conv-absorp contest (1 row)

The `STATS_BOX_H = 290.0` constant in `bar_selection.rs` is used for hit-testing the
stats box drag zone — it is a conservative approximation of the maximum height including
all divergence rows.

## 11. Algorithm Complexity

The function processes N bars (where N = `distance + 1` = the selection size):

| Step                     | Complexity | Notes                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Collect `bars` Vec       | O(N)       | One pass over `tick_aggr.datapoints`           |
| Sort `order` (unstable)  | O(N log N) | Single sort pass, reused by rank_norm AND AUC  |
| Rank normalization       | O(N)       | Linear scan over `order` with tie grouping     |
| Per-direction aggregates | O(N)       | Single fold over `bars.iter().enumerate()`     |
| IWDS                     | O(N)       | Two sums over `bars`                           |
| AUC rank-sum             | O(N)       | Single filtered iteration over `order`         |
| Log₂ ratio               | O(1)       | Computed from already-computed means           |
| Conviction + Absorption  | O(1)       | Computed from already-computed means           |
| Climax filter            | O(N)       | Single scan with `rank_norm[i] > 0.75` filter  |
| Divergence detection     | O(1)       | Boolean comparisons on already-computed values |
| Rendering                | O(1)       | Fixed max ~12 lines, dynamic height            |

**Total: O(N log N)** dominated by the sort.

N is typically 5–200 bars for practical selections; maximum possible is the total loaded
bar count (~13,000–20,000), but selecting thousands of bars is not a typical use case.
At N=200, the sort is negligible (<1 µs on aarch64).

The key optimization is the **single sort pass**: `order` is sorted once and used by
both the rank normalization algorithm and the AUC calculation. Without this sharing,
a naive implementation would require two sort passes, or keeping a separate sorted
structure for AUC computation.

---

## 12. Worked Example: 5-Bar Selection

Suppose a user selects 5 consecutive bars with the following properties:

| Bar | Direction | Raw intensity (t/s) |
| --- | --------- | ------------------- |
| 0   | Up        | 120                 |
| 1   | Up        | 45                  |
| 2   | Down      | 180                 |
| 3   | Up        | 30                  |
| 4   | Down      | 90                  |

So `n = 5`, `n_up = 3`, `n_dn = 2`.

### Step 1: Sort

Sorting by raw intensity ascending: `[30, 45, 90, 120, 180]`
→ `order = [3, 1, 4, 0, 2]` (bar indices in sorted order)

### Step 2: Rank Normalization

n = 5, so rank positions are divided by (n - 1) = 4:

| Sorted pos | Bar idx | Raw | rank_norm       |
| ---------- | ------- | --- | --------------- |
| 0          | 3       | 30  | 0.0 / 4 = 0.000 |
| 1          | 1       | 45  | 1.0 / 4 = 0.250 |
| 2          | 4       | 90  | 2.0 / 4 = 0.500 |
| 3          | 0       | 120 | 3.0 / 4 = 0.750 |
| 4          | 2       | 180 | 4.0 / 4 = 1.000 |

No ties in this example. `rank_norm = [0.750, 0.250, 1.000, 0.000, 0.500]`
(indexed by bar, not sorted position).

### Step 3: Per-Direction Aggregates

Up-bars: bars 0, 1, 3 → rank_norm = [0.750, 0.250, 0.000], raw = [120, 45, 30]

- `sum_t_up = 0.750 + 0.250 + 0.000 = 1.000` → `mean_t_up = 1.000 / 3 = 0.333`
- `sum_raw_up = 120 + 45 + 30 = 195` → `mean_raw_up = 65.0 t/s`

Down-bars: bars 2, 4 → rank_norm = [1.000, 0.500], raw = [180, 90]

- `sum_t_dn = 1.000 + 0.500 = 1.500` → `mean_t_dn = 1.500 / 2 = 0.750`
- `sum_raw_dn = 180 + 90 = 270` → `mean_raw_dn = 135.0 t/s`

### Step 4: IWDS

`total_raw = 120 + 45 + 180 + 30 + 90 = 465`

Signed sum: `120×(+1) + 45×(+1) + 180×(-1) + 30×(+1) + 90×(-1)`
= `120 + 45 - 180 + 30 - 90 = -75`

`iwds = -75 / 465 = -0.161`

→ Slightly net bearish by intensity. IWDS is just below the -0.15 threshold.
Flow suffix: `← lean` (|IWDS| = 0.161, in the 0.10–0.30 lean band).

### Step 5: Mann-Whitney AUC

1-indexed ranks of up-bars in `order = [3, 1, 4, 0, 2]`:

- Bar 3: position 0 → rank 1
- Bar 1: position 1 → rank 2
- Bar 0: position 3 → rank 4

`r_up = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7`
`u_up = 7 - 3 × (3 + 1) / 2 = 7 - 6 = 1`
`auc = 1 / (3 × 2) = 0.167`

Interpretation: up-bars won only 16.7% of head-to-head matchups. Down-bars were
consistently more intense in direct comparison. AUC suffix: `← strong edge` (distance
from 0.5 = 0.333, well above the 0.15 threshold).

### Step 6: Log₂ Ratio

`log₂(65.0 / 135.0) = log₂(0.481) = -1.056`

Interpretation: down-bars averaged about 2× more intensity than up-bars (more precisely,
2^1.056 ≈ 2.08×).

### Step 7: Conviction and Absorption

`dominant_up = (n_up >= n_dn) = (3 >= 2) = true` (more up-bars by count)

`conviction = mean_t_up / mean_t_dn = 0.333 / 0.750 = 0.444`

Interpretation: conviction < 1.0 — the majority direction (up) has _lower_ intensity
rank than the minority (down). Exhaustion signal.

`absorption = mean_t_dn = 0.750`

Interpretation: absorption is very high (0.75 > 0.65). Absorption suffix: `← heavy pushback`.
The down-bars — even though fewer — were fighting hard.

### Step 8: Climax

Top quartile: bars where `rank_norm > 0.75`:

- Bar 2: rank_norm = 1.000 > 0.75 ✓ (is_up = false)

`top_n = 1`, `top_up = 0`
`climax_up_frac = 0 / 1 = 0.00`

The sole top-quartile bar was a down-bar. `climax_up_frac ≤ 0.22` → `BEAR CLIMAX ◈`

Climax divergence check: `(n_up >= n_dn) = true` but `(climax_up_frac >= 0.5) = false`
→ these differ → **climax_divergence = true**.

### Step 9: Divergence Detection

- **Climax divergence**: true (bears dominated peaks, bulls won count) → ⚡ rows
- **Urgency-count split**: `(n_up >= n_dn) = true` vs `(mean_raw_up >= mean_raw_dn) = false`
  → these differ → **urgency_count_diverge = true** → ⚡ row
- **Conv-absorp contest**: conviction = 0.444 < 1.5 → **false**, no ⚡ row

### Step 10: Regime Classification

1. `climax_up_frac = 0.00 ≤ 0.22` → **`BEAR CLIMAX ◈`** (fired first, climax takes priority)

### Step 11: ASCII Bar

`fill = round(5.0 + (-0.161) × 5.0) = round(5.0 - 0.805) = round(4.195) = 4`

`[████░░░░░░]  flow: -0.16  ← lean`

### Final Display

```
15 bars    ↑ 3  (60%)    ↓ 2  (40%)
─────────────────────────────────────
↑t 0.33  ↑ 65 t/s      ↓t 0.75  ↓ 135 t/s
[████░░░░░░]  flow: -0.16  ← lean
BEAR CLIMAX ◈
sellers 2.1× more urgent  ← structural edge
P(↑>↓): 17%   log₂: -1.06  ← strong edge
conv: 0.44×   absorp: 0.75  ← heavy pushback
◈ climax: 100% ↓  (of top-25% bars)
⚡ DIVERGES: bears 100% of peak moments
   — vs bull count 60% overall
⚡ SPLIT: sellers faster, bulls win more bars
```

Box has a magenta border. The pattern: 3 up-bars, 2 down-bars, but the down-bars were
far more intense. The most frenzied bar was a down-bar. Despite a bar count majority,
the buying looks exhausted: low conviction (0.44), high seller absorption (0.75), and
the only top-quartile bar going down. Two divergence signals fire simultaneously.
Classic microstructure picture of a top with absorption into the rally.

## 13. Integration Points in the Codebase

### Call Site

```rust
// src/chart/kline.rs — inside legend cache closure
if let (Some(anchor), Some(end)) = (state.anchor, state.end) {
    if let PlotData::TickBased(tick_aggr) = &self.data_source {
        draw_bar_selection_stats(frame, palette, tick_aggr, anchor, end, state.stats_box_pos);
    }
}
```

### `BarSelectionState` Fields

Defined in `src/chart/kline/bar_selection.rs`:

```rust
pub(super) struct BarSelectionState {
    pub(super) anchor: Option<usize>,
    pub(super) end: Option<usize>,
    pub(super) shift_held: bool,
    pub(super) dragging_brim: Option<BrimSide>,
    pub(super) stats_box_pos: Option<Point>,   // None = default top-centre
    pub(super) dragging_stats_box: bool,
    pub(super) stats_drag_offset: (f32, f32),  // cursor offset from box origin at drag-start
}
```

`stats_box_pos` is set by left-drag on the stats box and reset to `None` on the third
Shift-click (selection restart). `stats_drag_offset` records the cursor's position
relative to the box origin at drag start, ensuring the box does not jump when drag begins.

### Interaction with `BarSelectionState`

`BarSelectionState` is held in a `RefCell<BarSelectionState>` inside `KlineChart`. The
legend layer borrows the state immutably to read `anchor`, `end`, and `stats_box_pos`,
then calls `draw_bar_selection_stats`. The selection highlight (the yellow brim handles
and the translucent region between them) is drawn in the `crosshair` layer, not in `main`.

Both `legend` and `crosshair` layers are invalidated together on `CursorMoved` events
(via `clear_crosshair()` which calls both). The `main` (candle bodies) cache is never
touched during selection interaction.

### Sentinel Guard

`snap_x_to_index()` returns `u64::MAX` when the cursor is in the forming-bar zone.
Selection anchors and endpoints are stored as `usize` visual indices. If `anchor` or
`end` was derived from a `u64::MAX` snap position, the code ignores it (the forming
bar has no completed microstructure). The guard in `BarSelectionState::try_set_end()`
rejects `u64::MAX` as an endpoint.

## 14. Design Rationale and Limitations

### Why Seven Metrics?

Each metric answers a different question that the others cannot:

| Metric     | Question                                         | Blind Spots of the Others                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `↑t / ↓t`  | "How hot were each direction's bars, on scale?"  | Does not say who won head-to-head                   |
| IWDS       | "Where did the total urgency flow?"              | One outlier bar dominates; AUC is robust to this    |
| AUC        | "Did up-bars consistently beat dn-bars?"         | Says nothing about magnitude of the edge            |
| log₂       | "How large is the raw rate advantage?"           | Not session-independent in isolation (but ratio is) |
| Conviction | "Is the majority direction also the urgent one?" | Does not tell us who the majority is by count       |
| Absorption | "How hard was the minority fighting?"            | Does not say who the minority is                    |
| Climax     | "Where was the most frenzied action?"            | Does not describe the overall distribution          |

Together they form a complete microstructure picture that no single metric can achieve.

### Limitations

1. **No statistical significance testing**: with N=5–20 bars, the Mann-Whitney p-value
   will rarely cross conventional thresholds. The metrics are descriptive, not inferential.
   Do not interpret `BULL CONVICTION` as "statistically proven bull signal".

2. **Bars with missing microstructure**: bars without microstructure data get `raw = 0.0`,
   which anchors them to rank_norm = 0.0 in the sort. If many bars lack microstructure
   (e.g. selecting across a data gap), the metrics will be misleading. Check the
   `↑t / ↓t` raw t/s values: if they show `0 t/s` for many bars, the data is sparse.

3. **Direction definition**: `is_up = close >= open` means a doji (open == close) counts
   as up. In selections with many dojis, the up/down split may not reflect what a trader
   would call "bullish" or "bearish". ODB bars rarely produce dojis due to the deviation
   threshold mechanic, but it is possible.

4. **No temporal ordering**: the metrics treat the selection as an unordered bag of bars.
   A selection where the first half is bear-conviction and second half is bull-conviction
   would show `CONTESTED`. Use the visual chart pattern alongside the overlay.

5. **Short selections (n ≤ 3)**: climax can only trigger if at least one bar exceeds the
   75th percentile rank. With n=1, `rank_norm = [0.5]`, so climax always shows `—`.
   With n=2, one bar will be at 0.0 and one at 1.0; the 1.0 bar exceeds the 0.75 threshold,
   so climax is based on just one bar. Interpret with caution for very short selections.

6. **Divergence signals are independent**: multiple ⚡ rows can fire simultaneously.
   Two or more active signals means several measurement dimensions are in disagreement —
   treat the overall regime label with reduced confidence. The panel does not aggregate
   divergence strength into a single score.

## 15. Relationship to the Trade Intensity Heatmap Indicator

The bar selection overlay and the `TradeIntensityHeatmap` indicator read from the same
underlying data — `OdbMicrostructure.trade_intensity: f32` stored in
`TickAccumulation.microstructure` — but use it in fundamentally different ways:

| Aspect              | Trade Intensity Heatmap                               | Bar Selection Overlay                                  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Reference window    | Rolling lookback (100–7000 bars), session-aware       | Within-selection only (completely session-independent) |
| Normalization       | Log-quantile percentile → bin 1..=K                   | Linear rank normalization → [0, 1] continuous          |
| Purpose             | Color individual bars relative to recent history      | Compute statistics across a user-defined range         |
| State               | Stored `HeatmapPoint` per bar, persisted              | Computed fresh each render from raw microstructure     |
| Visualization       | Candle body and wick color                            | Stats overlay box (top-center of chart)                |
| Session sensitivity | Affected by session (rolling window crosses sessions) | Session-independent (normalizes within selection)      |

The heatmap's `t` value (`(bin - 1) / (k_actual - 1)`) and the overlay's `rank_norm[i]`
are both normalized intensity scores in `[0, 1]`, but they are computed against different
reference populations and are not interchangeable.

A bar that appears green (cold, K3) on the heatmap might still have the highest
`rank_norm` in a short selection of similarly cold bars — and vice versa, a hot-colored
bar might be rank_norm = 0.5 in a selection that includes even hotter bars.
